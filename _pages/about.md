I am a Researcher at the Embodied AI Center, Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. My research focuses on graph learning, robotics learning, and autonomous driving. I have explored various applications of graph learning in autonomous driving, transportation, and physical simulations.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Electronic Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), advised by Prof. [Hongkai Xiong](https://min.sjtu.edu.cn/En/FacultyShow/4?Vid=14). From 2018 to 2019, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the Signal Processing Laboratory (LTS4) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), co-supervised by Prof. [Pascal Frossard](https://people.epfl.ch/pascal.frossard). Before that, I achieved my B.S. in Electronic Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, receiving the the SJTU Outstanding Bachelor's Thesis (Top 1%).

I warmly welcome interested students and interns to reach out via email if you are interested in collaboration!
